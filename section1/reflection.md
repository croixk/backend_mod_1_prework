## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I thought the SuperLearner article was very helpful.

I already try to view learning as a process, but I want to continue to emphasize this.

I would like to work on taking more short breaks, to improve productivity overall - sometimes I think that my productivity drops off if I don't take enough breaks.

I also think that emphasizing the benefits of struggling is good.
